# BlackjackProjectJava
A recreation of the classic card game 21, otherwise known as Blackjack, in Java. 

This is a game I made as a final project for a college course.
The general rules used for this application can be found [here](http://www.hitorstand.net/strategy.php), with more 
specific rules available on the [Bicycle Cards](http://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/) website. This version
is rudimentary and does not include any betting system, automated choosing of the value of Ace, or a way for a second person
to play(it uses RNG instead). 

## Compilation Instructions
1. Download or Clone this GitHub repository.
2. Unzip the .zip file and put the folder anywhere on your computer.
3. Open the folder in the Netbeans IDE to import it as an existing project.
4. Run the project.
